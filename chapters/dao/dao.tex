\chapter{Case: Decentralized Energy and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations}
\label{sec:dao}

\cite{gsma2014} gives a good overview of energy access in sub-saharan africa. Discusses solar home systems, mini-grids, and on-grid systems. Stresses the role of cellular connectivity and pay-as-you-go models. According to the report around 40\% of on-grid energy gets stolen. Furthermore, they provide a graph on the evolution of electrification rate and the rate for cellular coverage.

\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/QadirSWC16} discuss the approach of resource pooling for wireless networks in the developing world. This could be used if providing connectivity to villages is implemented as an additional service by the DAO.

Rooftop solar is already competitive in some areas in India. Storage costs are still high, but falling. Stress the need for private investments and the need to tap global capital markets.
