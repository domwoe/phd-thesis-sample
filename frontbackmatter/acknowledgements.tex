\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

% I want to thank Satoshi Nakamoto for giving birth to this extraordinary technology that touches so many aspects of technology, as well as culture and society. But I can not be sure if I would have seen the potential if there was no Kay, who became the voice of BitcoinTalk and r/bitcoin in the office. I am grateful for the atmosphere in the Bosch Lab, and at Elgar's chairs in Zurich and St. Gallen in general. I thank Paul for always being honest and authentic, trying all the gadgets, and spending time in the mountains with me. I thank Andre for being scientifically serious and funny from one second to the other. I thank team Tank-light for enlightenment (sooner or later). I thank Stefan for taking me on backcountry skiing trips. I thank Kristina for winning card games with me. I thank Dirk for always being in the office, many interesting discussions, humiliation in table tennis, and a lot of other activities that kept me healthy and productive. Most of all I thank Thomas for sharing all the hours put into our projects and still being able to spend leisure time together. I thank Markus. I thank Felix. I thank Elgar. I thank Bosch, SNF, Media Lab. Sandy, Thomas, Neha, Andrew, Michael...
